# Gigamidi
Takes the bin output from Miditones https://github.com/LenShustek/miditones and generates source<br/>
code data that you can include in your projects for MIDI scores.<br/>

## Building
A single source file using any modern C\+\+11 or higher compiler, trivial to build at a command prompt.</br>

## Usage
- gigamidi \<input filename\> \<output filename\> \<format 0, 1, 2, 3\> \<address in hex\> \<offset in hex\> \<count\> \<line length\><br/>
- Input: Miditones binary file produced with miditones, e.g. miditones -t4 -b \<filename\>.bin<br/>
- Format: 0 = vCPU ASM, 1 = GCL, 2 = C/C++, 3 = Python<br/>

## Address
The address, **_(specified in hex)_**, is the start address in RAM of where the MIDI byte sequence will be loaded to.<br/>

## Offset
The offset, **_(specified in hex)_**, is the offset used to determine the starting location of each new segment.<br/>

## Count
The count is the maximum number of bytes contained within each segment.

## Line length
The line length specifies the maximum size of each line of output source code.<br/>

## Example
gigamidi game_over.bin game_over.i 0 0x08A0 0x100 96 100<br/>
This would segment the MIDI stream into the unused areas of video memory, the segments are linked together<br/>
through the **_0xD0_** Segment command, (see below), and are automatically fetched and played in sequence.<br/>

## Format
The output format is very similar to the Miditones output format except for a few crucial differences.<br/>
1) The Gigatron's Maximum channels, (tone generators), is limited to 4, so you **_must_** use the -t4 option<br/>
with Miditones.<br/>
2) The Gigatron does not support volume or instrument changes, so you **_cannot_** use the -i or -v options<br/>
with Miditones.<br/>
3) The wait or delay command has been changed from 2 bytes and 1ms resolution to 1 byte and 16.66667ms<br/>
resolution; this has a number of important impacts.
    - You cannot have a delay longer than 2116ms, so any MIDI score that does will have serious timing issues.<br/>
    - Very short delays will either be rounded down to 0ms or rounded up to 16.6666667ms, this **_will_** affect<br/>
timing, how much of a problem it causes is completely dependent on the MIDI score and your playback architecture.<br/>

## Player

There is currently a MIDI player written in vCPU ASM that implements all the functionality within this specification.<br/>
Other languages are yet to be implemented as of the date of this document, but it is not a difficult task to accomplish.<br/>

Once a player has been written, it expects to be called at least once every 16.66666667ms, the simplest way to achieve this,<br/>
is to wait for **_VBlank_** and then call the player; this will work perfectly unless other parts of your code spend more than<br/>
one VBlank processing. If this is the case, these hot spots will need to have a **_Check VBlank Call Player_** function within<br/>
their loops or code.<br/>

## Stream
The byte stream produced by Miditones is composed of a number of commands, these commands are differentiated<br/>
from delays by the most significant bit of the command byte. The only commands that are supported by the Gigatron<br/>
and hence Gigamidi are the following:<br/>
1) **_Note On_**        $9t $nn play note **_nn_** on tone generator **_t_**.<br/>
2) **_Note Off_**       $8t stop playing on tone generator **_t_**.<br/>
3) **_Segment_**        $D0 $nnnn contains the absolute 16bit address of the next segment.<br/>
4) **_Wait_**           $nn waits **_nn_** x 16.666666667ms before processing the next command in<br/>
the stream. So the maximum delay is 0x7F \* 16.66666667ms.<br/>

The Segment command, **_(0xD0)_** is a powerful **_(Gigatron only)_**, command embedded within the MIDI byte stream,<br/>
(generated automatically by Gigamidi), that not only allows the MIDI data to be spread over multiple fragmented areas<br/>
of memory, but also allows you to sequence and chain multiple MIDI streams together without writing any code.<br/>

The last command **_($d0# $a0# $09#)_** within the game over MID byte stream is a Segment address that points to the<br/>
next segment of MIDI data to process; in this example it would probably point back to the title MIDI byte stream.<br/>
If the game_overMIDI byte stream did not fit in that section of memory, then 0xD0 commands would be used to chain<br/>
multiple segments of the byte stream together.<br/>
